# Miscellaneous tools
Random mix of (hopefully) useful small scripts

This repository is meant to contain things I wrote and figured could be useful to other people I'm working with.

They may be tailored to the way we work in our lab and to our data files/structures, so no guarantee they will be useful to someone from the outside without at least a few modifications, sorry!

## Primer Finder
A script that will check a database of primers against a sequence of interest and will report the matches by generating an interactive figure displaying the region, orientation, and errors of primer matches.
